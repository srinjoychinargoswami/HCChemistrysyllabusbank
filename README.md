This is a website with access to syllabi from all the Chemistry Courses (major Core, elective and Non-Major) and Co-requisite and collateral courses towards the Chemistry Major. 
There are also Chemistry major concentration track pages with all the classes needed for the particular tracks of the Chemistry Major: Biology Standard, Biology with a Concentration 
in behavioral neurobiology, Biology with concentration in Bioinformatics and Biology with a concentration in Biophysics.I am making this after being inspired by Computer Science 
majors and Current and Former Hunter Students Richard Aguilar and, Jonathan Swift, Robert O'Conner and others who made a website with syllabus directory for Computer Science 
courses and the collteral courses at Hunter College. This is the second site I have made the first being for Biology majors. The link to that is below. In addition to making the syllabus for various courses available, I have attached a MEGA linked here with all the textbooks 
from the courses if they are available as PDF's online. I do apologize in advance if its not available for certain courses. I am working to procure all of them for all courses.
I would like the most up to date syllabuses as possible meaning from Fall 2019-Spring 2020 to Current or when the course was last taught with the professor who taught it.
